NP-hardness when restricted to interval graphs has been recently announced. Surprisingly, all previously published attempts at polynomial-time algorithms for unit interval graphs turned out to be wrong, which justifies the search for subclasses where MaxCut can be handled. We introduce canonical cuts whose pattern allows an easy computation of the cut size for the power of paths $P_n^k$. Using canonical cuts, we calculate the structure and the size of maximum cuts for $k\\leq 5$ and for $n\\leq \\frac{2}{3}(2k+2)$. We prove that the known size for a maximum cut for reduced co-bipartite chain graphs can be achieved by a canonical cut. We perform computational experiments on each $P_n^k$ graph with $1\\leq k\\leq n\\leq 43$ and show that most of them allow a canonical cut that is maximum. We display a table with the found cases where there is no canonical cut which is a maximum cut. In these graphs, the difference between the maximum cut and some canonical is at most 3 units. This indicates canonical cuts as a good approach to tackle the maximum cut on $P_n^k$ graphs.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.55016\/ojs\/cdm.v19i3.72392","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,1]],"date-time":"2024-11-01T18:42:26Z","timestamp":1730486546000},"page":"121-136","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Canonical cuts of path powers"],"prefix":"10.55016","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"Liliana","family":"Alcon","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Luerbio","family":"Faria","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Celina","family":"Figueiredo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marisa","family":"Gutierrez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sulamita","family":"Klein","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ueverton","family":"Souza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rubens","family":"Sucupira","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"13844","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,23]]},"container-title":["Contributions to Discrete Mathematics"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/cdm.ucalgary.ca\/article\/download\/72392\/57692","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/cdm.ucalgary.ca\/article\/download\/72392\/57692","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,1]],"date-time":"2024-11-01T18:42:27Z","timestamp":1730486547000},"score":0.0,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/cdm.ucalgary.ca\/article\/view\/72392"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,23]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,23]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.55016\/ojs\/cdm.v19i3.72392","ISSN":["1715-0868"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1715-0868","type":"electronic"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,23]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,2]],"date-time":"2024-11-02T04:13:48Z","timestamp":1730520828165,"version":"3.28.0"},"reference-count":6,"publisher":"Trans Tech Publications, Ltd.","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,8]],"date-time":"2009-10-08T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1254960000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/www.scientific.net\/PolicyAndEthics\/PublishingPolicies"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,8]],"date-time":"2009-10-08T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1254960000000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/www.scientific.net\/license\/TDM_Licenser.pdf"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["KEM"],"abstract":"<jats:p>In this study, we propose an interesting scheme for analyzing micro-pillar compression test results based on finite element method. It uses only load and displacement data measured by micro-pillar compression test, a framework of conventional incremental metal plasticity, and an iterative scheme for updating the material parameters. This is an inverse approach to determine the constitutive relation of materials based on experimentally measured load and displacement. As a demonstrative example, Ni-Co micro-pillars with a diameter of 10 \u339b and a height of 20 \u339b were fabricated by micro-machining process, and their load-displacement data were measured by a micro-pillar compression tester. Using the proposed scheme and the measured load-displacement data, the stress-strain curves for the Ni-Co micro-pillars were estimated.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/kem.417-418.189","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,12]],"date-time":"2009-10-12T21:01:25Z","timestamp":1255381285000},"page":"189-192","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["An Iterative FEA Scheme for Analysis of Micro-Pillar Compression Test"],"prefix":"10.4028","volume":"417-418","author":[{"given":"Jae Hyun","family":"Kim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials"}]},{"given":"Hyun Ju","family":"Choi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials"}]},{"given":"Bong Kyun","family":"Jang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials"}]},{"given":"Hak Joo","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials"}]},{"given":"Byung Ik","family":"Choi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials"}]}],"member":"2457","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,8]]},"reference":[{"key":"2904781","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"J.R.
